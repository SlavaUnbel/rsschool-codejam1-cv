			<p>Hi, my name is Slava Levkovich, and I'm very glad to introduce myself to you. I'm a student of the 3<sub>rd</sub> course in BSEU University. I didn't have an experience in IT before. It appreciates me, first of all, because it seems very intresting to create something new by just typing some code. A few hours of hard work and you can see the result in your successfully working program.</p><hr>
			<p>As I said, I didn't have experience before. But I'm an ambitious person and I always achieve my goals. This summer I got intrested in Informatical Technologies and started my self-education. And, finally, I signed up for these courses.</p><hr>
			<p>I know how difficult is the way of those people, who are trying to study this discipline, but I'll do my best, keep studying and be up-to-date. I want you to believe in me and my ability to work hard and never give up when facing difficulties.</p>
