			<p>Hi, my name is Slava Levkovich, and I'm very glad to introduce myself to you. I'm a student of the 3<sub>rd</sub> course in <a href="http://www.bseu.by/">BSEU University</a>. I didn't have an experience in IT before. It appreciates me, first of all, because it seems very intresting to create something new by just typing some code. A few hours of hard work and you can see the result in your successfully working program.</p>
			<p>As I said, I didn't have experience before. But I'm an ambitious person and I always achieve my goals. This summer I got intrested in Informatical Technologies and started my self-education. And, finally, I signed up for these courses.</p>
			<p>I know how difficult is the way of those people, who are trying to study this discipline, but I'll do my best, keep studying and be up-to-date. I want you to believe in me and my ability to work hard and never give up when facing difficulties.</p>

			<h2 id="skills">My skills</h2>
			<p>I can't say, that I know JavaScript very well, that's why I'm here. My self-studying helped me to receive some skills, <strong>like:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li class="narration">HTML(also HTML 5 semantic layout)</li>
				<li class="narration">CSS</li>
				<li class="narration">Git</li>
				<li class="narration">JavaScript</li>
			</ul>
			<p>But I'm getting acquainted with more and more information about <em>front-end developing</em>.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2 id="code-example">Code Examples</h2>
			<p>I will show you some JavaScript codes, which were our tasks on the 1<sub>st</sub> stage.</p>
			<p>This is the 4<sub>th</sub> task "Quadratic-equation". Here I used ES5 standard because I didn't read about the ES6.</p>
				<pre><code>function solveEquation(equation) {
	var array=equation.split(' '); 
	var a=+array[0]; 
	var b=+array[4]; 
	var c=+array[8];

	if(array[3]=='-') b=-b; 
	if(array[7]=='-') c=-c;

	var D = Math.sqrt(Math.pow(b,2) - 4 * a * c); 
	var x1 = (-b - D) / (2 * a); 
	var x2 = (-b + D) / (2 * a); 
	var arr = [Math.round(x1), Math.round(x2)]; 

	return arr.sort(function(a,b) { 
		return a - b; 
	});
}</code></pre>
			<p>Now let's look at the 8<sub>th</sub> task "Advanced-zeros". While doing this task, I was also looking a lecture about ES6 standard. So here I used it, as you can see.</p>
				<pre><code>function getZerosCount(number, base) {
	const multipliers = getMultipliers(number, base);
	const zerosArray = [];
 
	for (let i = 0; i &lt; multipliers.length; i++) {
    	const currentMultiplier = multipliers[i].value;
    	let components = 0;
 
    	for (let n = 1; Math.pow(currentMultiplier, n) &lt;= number; n++) {
      		components += Math.floor(number / Math.pow(currentMultiplier, n));
    	}
 
    	zerosArray.push(Math.floor(components / multipliers[i].count));
	}
 
  	return Math.min(...zerosArray);
}
 
	function getMultipliers(number, base) {
  		const multipliers = [];
 
  		if (base > 1) {
    		for (var i = 2; i &lt;= base; i++) {
      			while (base % i === 0 && base > 1) {
        			multipliers.push(i);
        			base = base / i;
      			}
      			if (base / i === 1) {
        			multipliers.push(base);
      			}
    		}
  		}
 
  		return getUniqMultipliers(multipliers)
	}
 
	function getUniqMultipliers(array) {
  		const uniqMultipliers = [];
 
  		for (let i = 0; i &lt; array.length; i++) {
    		if (!uniqMultipliers.includes(array[i])) {
      			uniqMultipliers.push(array[i]);
    		}
  		}
 
  		return uniqMultipliers.map((uniqMultiplier) => {
    		const count = array.filter(multiplier => multiplier === uniqMultiplier).length;
 
    		return {
      			value: uniqMultiplier,
      			count: count
    		}
  		})
	}</code></pre>
			<p><em>It's my favorite tasks, so I decided to show exactly them.</em></p>

			<h2 id="experience">My experience</h2>
			<p>I had a lot of experience while I was working with HTML & CSS, now I'm working hard on your tasks about JavaScript. I passed courses on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com">Codeacademy</a>. Also I can show you what I've done in HTML & CSS, started doing tasks in JavaScript:</p>

			<h2 id="education">My education</h2>
			<p>I'm a student of economic university, but I spend my free time on education in IT. I should say, that there are so many resources to learn. I started from books:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="narration"><a href="https://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/21469102/">HTML & CSS. Developing and Design of websites</a></li>
				<li class="narration"><a href="https://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/140543672/">JavaScript & jQuery. Interactive web-development</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>I didn't finish the second book, but I will do it soon. Also there is a useful cite, where everything about frontend development is described:</p> 
				<p><a href="http://learn.javascript.ru/">Study book</a></p>
			<p>I also visit some webinars on <a href="http://youtube.com/">YouTube</a>, read news on <a href="http://habr.com/">Habr</a> and find sources to study, for example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="narration"><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">Free Code Camp</a></li>
				<li class="narration"><a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a></li>
				<li class="narration"><a href="https://www.interviewcake.com/all-questions/javascript">Interview Cake</a></li>
				<li class="narration"><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/duke-programming-web">Coursera</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>I use all possibilities to develop myself in this sphere, also I visit offline seminars, where people talk about new features of programming languages, abot trends in IT, about ways to develop.</p>

			<h2 id="english-level">My English Level</h2>
			<p>I shoul say, that my mother is a teacher of English, so I'm studying it from the 1<sub>st</sub> form. I won district olympiads every year, starting from the 4<sub>th</sub> form. Now I have <strong>B2 Upper-Intermediate level.</strong></p>
			<p>To prove that I want to show you my science work. I can do it only by giving a link to the file, because the source, where my work is publicated, is not in free access. It's about economist's position on the world labor market: <a download href="../International_conference.zip">Download work</a></p>
